# 🛠️ Common Instructions for MY-BRAND Portfolio Refactor

This document defines the common guidelines and conventions to follow while working on the **MY-BRAND** portfolio project refactor to **Next.js (App Router)**.

This Website will be serving my vision so, it is not only about the website as the portfolio but Personal branding as a **Full Stack Software Engineer** with depth in AI/ML, Cloud Native, IoT, and System Architecture. All content — including entrepreneurial experience and community contributions — should be framed as supporting evidence of software engineering expertise.

## 🚀 Project Goal

Refactor the existing HTML/JS/Tailwind portfolio project into a modern, scalable, and maintainable **Next.js App Router** project. The project must retain the current **brand identity and color scheme**, while improving layout, structure, and content representation for a more modern user experience.

---

## 📁 Structure & Organization

- Use **Next.js App Router** (inside `/app/` directory).
- Follow a **feature-based** and **atomic design system** approach:

my-brand-nextjs/
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── 
│   │   ├── layout.tsx
│   │   ├── page.tsx
│   │   ├── about/
│   │   ├── projects/
│   │   ├── blog/
│   │   ├── contact/
│   │   └── skills/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── atoms/
│   │   │   ├── Button/
│   │   │   ├── Input/
│   │   │   ├── Typography/
│   │   │   └── Icon/
│   │   ├── molecules/
│   │   │   ├── Card/
│   │   │   ├── FormGroup/
│   │   │   └── SocialLinks/
│   │   └── organisms/
│   │       ├── Header/
│   │       ├── Footer/
│   │       ├── Hero/
│   │       └── ContactForm/
│   ├── features/
│   │   ├── about/
│   │   ├── projects/
│   │   ├── blog/
│   │   └── contact/
│   ├── lib/
│   │   ├── utils.ts
│   │   └── constants.ts
│   ├── styles/
│   └── types/
├── public/
│   └── images/
├── tailwind.config.ts
└── next.config.js

- Each **feature** should be encapsulated in its own folder under `/features/`.
- Keep components reusable, readable, and isolated.

## 🎨 Design System Guidelines

- **Tailwind CSS** is the primary styling method.
- Use **existing design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing)** from the legacy project.
- You may enhance the visual appearance while preserving the original identity.
- Apply **modern layout principles**:
- Responsive by default
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- Fluid typography and clean hierarchy
- All UI elements should be built using **atomic design** principles:
- `atoms/`: small, reusable pieces (buttons, inputs, labels)
- `molecules/`: groups of atoms (form groups, cards)
- `organisms/`: full sections (navbars, footers, hero blocks)

---

## 📦 Component & Code Guidelines

- Use **TypeScript** for all files.
- Follow **Next.js best practices** (e.g., `loading.tsx`, `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`).
- Use **React Server Components** where applicable (static and non-interactive).
- Use **Client Components** only when interactivity is required (`"use client"`).
- All pages must define **`metadata`** using the new `metadata` API for SEO.
- Always use `Typography` components for text elements.
- Every component has to support both theme: `dark` and `light`. The default theme is `dark`. Theme witching will be performed by Tailwind css automatically so, `dark:` class has to be used for `dark` theme styling.

---

## 🔐 Accessibility & Performance

- Use semantic HTML elements (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, etc.).
- Ensure all interactive elements are accessible (e.g., buttons, links).
- Avoid excessive animations or DOM-heavy layouts.
- Prefer **optimized images** and lazy loading where needed.

---

## 🌐 Routing & Navigation

- Implement modern and mobile-friendly **navigation with responsive menu**.
- Use **file-based routing** inside the `app/` directory.
- Ensure proper linking between all sections and pages using `next/link`.

---

## ✅ Commit & PR Guidelines

- Use clear and concise commit messages (e.g., `feat: migrate about section`, `refactor: update hero layout`).
- Keep PRs small, focused, and scoped to a specific section or feature.
- Always run and test locally before committing.

---

## 📍 Important Notes

- The goal is **not to change the identity**, but to **modernize and improve structure, maintainability, and usability**.
- Avoid overengineering — stick to what’s necessary and elegant.
- Keep scalability in mind for future expansion (e.g., adding a blog or CMS).
